<p>This is my third webpage. I created it for GIS 3410 at MSUD.</p>
     <p>The purpose of this lab was to teach us how to code webpages in HTML. I think this is pretty cool.</p>
     <h2>This is my second heading</h2>
     <p>Using heading can be very useful to help readers keep the correct flow of reading a webpage.</p>
     <p>Headings can also aid the visually impaired in being able to read a document.</p>
